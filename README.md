OpenBazaar eCommerce Plugin for websites! [WIP]

Website plugin that enables website owners to use the OpenBazaar network as a backend for Inventory Management, Payment processing, ratings and buyer protection. Note that this is a work in progress, and is not suitable for a production environment

Usage:
index.html is just a shell website where the store would be loaded, this would be replaced by the website of whoever is using the plugin.

TODO:
*Fix the store overlay and start working on the store views.
